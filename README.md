cd nasa_project
```
4. Create virtual enviroment, run the next command:
```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```
<a name="env"></a> 
5. Activate virtual enviroment, run the next command:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
6. Create folder for the app:
```bash
mkdir app
```
7. Open your `app` folder:
```bash
cd app
```
8. Run the next command for downloading `repo`:

git clone https://github.com/djeck1432/NASA.git
```
9. Install all requirement packages, run the next command:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## How to use
In terminal, run the next commnads:
Please, activate your `enviroment` before you will use the code. How to activate, click [here](#env)
